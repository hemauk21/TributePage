        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p> Teresa was in her early years when she was fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.
        </p>
        <h3>Missionaries of Charity</h3>
        <p>She began missionary work with the poor in 1948, replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums. She founded a school in Motijhil, Kolkata, before she began tending to the poor and hungry. At the beginning of 1949 Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".</p>
        <h3>Recognition</h3>
        <p>
          Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize "for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". When Teresa received the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered,"Go home and love your family." Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa">"Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society â€“ that poverty is so hurtable and so much, and I find that very difficult."
